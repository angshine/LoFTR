## Code release ETA
We plan to release the inference-only code and pretrained model within the upcoming week, stay tuned. 
The entire codebase for data pre-processing, training and validation is under major refactoring and will be released around June.
Please subscribe to [this discussion thread](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR/discussions/2) if you wish to be notified of the code release.
In the meanwhile, discussions about the paper are welcomed in the [discussion panel](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR/discussions).

<!-- ## Acknowledgment

This repo is built based on the Mask R-CNN implementation from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark), and we also use the pretrained Stereo R-CNN weight from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rZ5AsMms7-oO-VfoNTAmBFOr8O2L0-xt/view?usp=sharing) for initialization. -->
